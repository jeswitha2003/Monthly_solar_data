# Monthly_solar_data
Data analysis project combining solar energy and mobility to explore sustainable EV charging

I used the csv data using PVWatt website, it shows how much solar energy is available at any specific location. Also this data i collected tells us how much solar power which is useful, that means removing all the losses, which we can actually use, do we get get each month from this solar setup.
So, I choose Berlin. Using real data from Pvwatt calculator i analysed how many electric vehicles can be fully charged using solar energy each month.

Tools used:
python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQL
